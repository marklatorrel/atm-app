# ATM APP 

## Description of the project

In this project I took the code from MIT Professor John Williams, consisting of two functions, the first funtion emulating an ATM and the other one emulating an bank Account. I styled the project and improved the validation.

## How to run

Just clone it and in the terminal, make the following command:

### `npm start`
